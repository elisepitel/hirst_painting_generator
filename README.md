[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst):
"Damien Hirst is an English artist. 
"Spot paintings" are rows of randomly coloured circles created by his assistants. (...) **Hirst sees the real creative act as being the conception, not the execution, and that, as the progenitor of the idea, he is therefore the artist.**"
