[Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst):
"Damien Hirst is an English artist. 
"Spot paintings" are rows of randomly coloured circles created by his assistants. Hirst said that he only painted five spot paintings himself because, "I couldn't be fucking arsed doing it (...) the best person who ever painted spots for me was Rachel. She's brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant. The best spot painting you can have by me is one painted by Rachel." He also describes another painting assistant who was leaving and asked for one of the paintings. Hirst told her to, "'make one of your own.' And she said, 'No, I want one of yours.' But the only difference, between one painted by her and one of mine, is the money.'" By February 1999, two assistants had painted 300 spot paintings. **Hirst sees the real creative act as being the conception, not the execution, and that, as the progenitor of the idea, he is therefore the artist.**"
